    description: |
      Introduce the new HttpGateway CRD. This will enable more flexible creation of multiple
      filter chains on a single listener. The translation code to support this resource
      is not yet created and will be done in a follow-up, hence why this is non user facing.

      Introduce httpgateways.gateway.solo.io CRD.
      HybridGateways can delegate to this resource, instead of requiring the
      entire definition to be inline.
