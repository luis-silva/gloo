changelog:
  - type: HELM
    description: >-
      Allow users to disable the default gateways, which can be helpful for users who configure the validation webhook
      to strict failures (i.e. `gloo.gateway.validation.failurePolicy: Fail`) so validation works on installation and
      upgrades. Once the gateway pod is running and healthy, the user can then apply the default gateways.
